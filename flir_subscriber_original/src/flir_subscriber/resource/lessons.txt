must import cv2 before import cv_bridge
when import torch, import it earlier than other packages, to avoid ImportError: /home/samuel/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/lib/../../torch.libs/libgomp-d22c30c5.so.1.0.0: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block

flir ros2 driver outputs images at 20fps
with cv_bridge decoder, still 20fps
with cv2 real time display, 15.7fps
with draw_label stroke, 15.3fps
with draw_label no stroke, 15.7fps
with draw_label no stroke, resize by 4, 13.8fps
with draw_label no stroke, resize by 4, inference without resize, 3.6fps

make sure to run model on gpu
model on gpu + no display, 20fps

change ros2_driver/install/setup.sh, COLCON_CURRENT_PREFIX="/opt/ros/foxy" to
